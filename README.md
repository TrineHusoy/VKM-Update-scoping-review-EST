## Abstract

This scoping review was commissioned by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. The aim was to update a previous scoping review of research literature on the effects of emulsifiers, stabilisers and thickeners (EST) on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, specifically agar (E 406), sodium alginate (E 401), carrageenan (E 407), processed Eucheuma seaweed (E 407a), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (E 466), gellan gum (E 418), guar gum (E 412), and xanthan gum (E 415). A scoping review contrasts with a safety evaluation that consists of assessment of biological and chemical properties, potential toxicity of any organ, and dietary exposure estimates. This scoping review maps any studies that reported effects, whether they are beneficial, neutral or adverse, on the GI tract. It does not report on measures of the strength of the relationship between EST exposures and effects on the GI tract. 

The literature search covered the period from March 1, 2023 (end of search of the previous review) to June 11, 2024. The search strategy and the eligibility criteria were the same in the previous and the updated scoping reviews. Fifteen studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria were identified in the previous scoping review (VKM, 2023). In addition, 214 studies fulfilled all eligibility criteria except the criterion that the substance tested must be in accordance with the regulations for food additives in the EU and Norway. The information about the substance tested in these studies was insufficient, and to obtain this information for the present update, the VKM sent requests by email to the corresponding authors of the publications, whenever such contact information was available (Appendix 1). If delivery failed, an effort was made to identify a new email address to which the request was re-sent. Six additional studies from five publications were included following receipt of requested information. No studies were included from the updated literature search. Four of the included studies examined effects of sodium alginate (E 401) and guar gum (E 412) in humans and two other studies examined effects of guar gum (E 412) and carboxymethyl cellulose (E 466) in pigs.  

From both the previous scoping review (VKM, 2023) and the present update, 21 controlled studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria were identified: five studies in humans and 16 in animals. The dose ranges reported or estimated, across all ESTs in the human and animal studies (four different species), were 36-214 mg/kg bw per day and 51-6000 mg/kg bw per day, respectively. The study durations of the human controlled studies were between 1 day and 1 week, hence acute exposures only. Study durations in four of the animal experimental studies were subchronic (exposure ≥13 weeks) and subacute (≤12 weeks) in the remainder.  

The endpoints addressed in the human studies were: 

*Faecal weight and consistency 

*Gastric emptying (time and frequency) 

*Glucose and insulin homeostasis 

*Satiety and appetite 


The endpoints addressed in the animal studies were: 

*Changes in gut microbiota composition or number of bacteria 

*Enzymatic activity (digestive, microbial, cell proliferation, and inflammatory) 

*Intestinal utilisation and fermentation of nutrients 

*Macroscopic changes (stomach, small intestine, colon) 

*Microscopic changes (digestive tract) including inflammation 

*Mucosal weight, content (colon) 

*Presence of blood or mucus in faeces 

*Tumor promotion in cancer-induced mice (genetic or chemical) 


VKM has not assessed whether the reported endpoints in the included studies may be beneficial or adverse or whether they are within normal physiological ranges.  

The risk of bias was assessed as high in the human studies and as high and moderate in the animal studies. High risk of bias means that there is high likelihood that the features of the study design or conduct of the study will give misleading results and thus, conclusions. 

### Conclusion  

The included studies on the effects of agar (E 406), sodium alginate (E 401), carrageenan (E 407), processed Eucheuma seaweed (E 407a), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (E 466), guar gum (E 412) and xanthan gum (E 415) on the gastrointestinal tract were few, and in most of the studies the potential for systematic errors in the results or findings was high. None of the studies lasted long enough to evaluate long-term exposure in humans. Thus, the evidence base will be weak for assessment of the risk for negative effects on the gastrointestinal tract in humans. The conclusion in the present updated scoping review, after inclusion of six additional studies, remains the same as in the previous scoping review (VKM, 2023).
