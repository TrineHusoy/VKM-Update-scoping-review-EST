Tomlin (1988);1988;Human controlled study, crossover. Latin-square design;7;Not reported;"Female and male; 6 males and one female";Reported to be healthy;Xanthan gum ;"Xanthan gum (E 415), as drink together with diet restricted in fiber; 15 gram per day"; Drinks three times a day (total of 15 g) and continued for one week;Basal values on the first week with no treatment;"Faecal or caecal content weight, colour, consistency, and/or viscosity; Gastric transit time and stool frequency";Not reported;Not reported;Investigate whether the degradation of viscous polysaccharides by colonic bacteria determines their effects on colonic function.;Not reported;;;;;
Mariotti (2001);2001;Human randomised  controlled study;7;Mean age = 23, range = 20-36 years;"Female and male; 5 males and 2 females";Reported to be healthy;Guar gum;"Two meals were prepared; one containing 30 g (316 mmol N) soy isolate, the other containing 30 g soy isolate combined with 5 g powdered guar gum (protein plus guar gum, PG)";One exposure per meal (every participant had both meals, one time);"Two test meals; with and without guar gum";"Gastric emptying kinetics; relative dietary plasma amino acids; plasma glucose and insulin concentrations; total, dietary, and endogenous plasma urea kinetics; urinary excretion of total, dietary, and endogenous nitrogen ";Not reported;Not reported;Determine whether guar gum could acutely affect the absorption and utilization of dietary nitrogen and whether these luminal effects could also perturb the kinetics of urea.;Not reported;;;;;
Hoad (2004);2004;Human randomised controlled study, crossover. Latin-square design;12;Mean age = 24 years, range = 19–29 years;"Female and male; 3 males and 9 females";Reported to be healthy;Guar gum, alginate ;Each participant ingested four different meals (325 ml) according to the Latin-square procedure. The control meal was a sugar-sweetened, vanilla-flavored, milk-based beverage. The  experimental meals contained 1% by weight of either weak-gelling alginate, strong-gelling alginate, and viscous guar gum added to the control meal;A single exposure of each study substance (one meal per participant per substance);"Four test meals; a control meal, two alginate meals (one weak-gelling alginate meal and one strong-gelling alginate meal), and a guar gum meal ";"Gastric emptying;  Satiety";The study was supported by Unilever Health Institute, Unilever R&D Vlaardingen, Vlaardingen, The Netherlands;Not reported;Investigate the satiating effects of 2 types of alginates, which gel weakly or strongly on exposure to acid, compared with guar gum whose viscosity is unaffected by acid.;;;;;;
Wanders (2013) (study 1)*;2013;Human randomised controlled study, crossover;120; Mean age = 25 years, range = 18–50 years  (SD 7);"Female and male; 45 males and 76 females ";Reported to be healthy;Guar gum and sodium alginate;Different cookies containing: no added fibre (control), added cellulose (bulking, 5 g/100 g), added guar gum (viscous, 1·25 g/100 g and 2·5 g/100 g), or added alginate (gel forming, 2·5 g/100 g and 5 g/100 g). The intake of each test product was ad libitum. Intake reported in g for each substance/control.;6 sessions, one per product, separated by at least 2 days;Six test products a control without added fibre, three products with added fibre (cellulose/ guar gum in 2 concentrations / alginate in 2 concentrations;Palatability, Satiety and oral exposure time;The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation (project KB-05-009-003);The authors state that there are no conflicts of interest;Determine the effects of dietary fibre with bulking, viscous and gel-forming properties on satiation, and to identify the underlying mechanisms.;Not reported;;;;;

Subjects consumed a fixed amount of the test products, which corresponded to
approximately 20 % of daily energy requirements";6 sessions, one per product, separated by at least 7 days;Six test products: a control without added fibre, three  products with added fibre (cellulose/ guar gum in 2 concentrations / alginate in 2 concentrations);"Gastric emptying rate; Satiety, appetite sensation";The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation (project KB-05-009-003);The authors state that there are no conflicts of interest;Determine the effects of dietary fibre with bulking, viscous and gel-forming properties on satiation, and to identify the underlying mechanisms.;Not reported;;;;;
